# Churn Prediction using Neural Networks

A neural network is a type of machine learning algorithm that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes or neurons that are organized into layers, with each layer processing and transforming the data before passing it on to the next layer. Neural networks can learn to recognize patterns and relationships in data, and they can be trained to make predictions based on this learning.

One application of neural networks is to predict customer churn, which is the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company. Customer churn can be costly for businesses, so it is important to identify customers who are likely to churn and take steps to prevent them from leaving. Neural networks can be used to analyze customer data and identify patterns and behaviors that are associated with churn. By training a neural network on historical data, it can learn to recognize these patterns and predict which customers are likely to churn in the future. This information can then be used by businesses to take proactive measures to retain those customers.

## Dependencies
The code requires the following dependencies to be installed:

* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn

# Usage
To use this code, you need to have the following files:

* **customer_data.csv** : Contains the historical customer data.
* **new_data.csv** : Contains the new customer data for which you want to predict churn.

The `customer_data.csv` file should contain the following columns:

* account_status
* other_behavioral_data
* churn

The `new_data.csv` file should contain the same columns except for the churn column, which is the one we want to predict.

Once you have the files, you can run the code using the following command:
`python3 NuetralNetwork.py`

This will print the accuracy, precision, and recall scores of the model on the test data and the churn predictions for the new data.

# Applications
The code can be used in many business scenarios where there is a need to predict customer churn. By predicting churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction. For example, businesses can offer discounts or promotions to customers who are at risk of churning or improve their customer service to prevent customers from leaving. The code can be modified to suit different business needs and can be used in a variety of industries such as telecommunications, banking, and e-commerce.
