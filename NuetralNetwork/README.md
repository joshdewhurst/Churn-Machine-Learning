# Churn Prediction using Neural Networks
This code is an implementation of a neural network algorithm for churn prediction, which is a common problem in the business world. The code uses customer data to predict whether a customer will churn or not.

## Dependencies
The code requires the following dependencies to be installed:

* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn

# Usage
To use this code, you need to have the following files:

* **customer_data.csv** : Contains the historical customer data.
* **new_data.csv** : Contains the new customer data for which you want to predict churn.

The `customer_data.csv` file should contain the following columns:

* account_status
* other_behavioral_data
* churn

The `new_data.csv` file should contain the same columns except for the churn column, which is the one we want to predict.

Once you have the files, you can run the code using the following command:
`python3 NuetralNetwork.py`

This will print the accuracy, precision, and recall scores of the model on the test data and the churn predictions for the new data.

# Applications
The code can be used in many business scenarios where there is a need to predict customer churn. By predicting churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction. For example, businesses can offer discounts or promotions to customers who are at risk of churning or improve their customer service to prevent customers from leaving. The code can be modified to suit different business needs and can be used in a variety of industries such as telecommunications, banking, and e-commerce.
