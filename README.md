# Churn-Machine-Learning

In this project, we want to develop a predictive model to identify customers who are at risk of churning (i.e., cancelling their subscription or leaving the service) so that we can take proactive steps to retain them. To do this, we plan to use a combination of spreadsheet analysis and machine learning algorithms.

# First, 
we'll start by analyzing historical data on customer behavior, such as the frequency of usage, the types of features used, and the length of time since they last used the service. We'll use spreadsheet tools like Excel or Google Sheets to create pivot tables and charts that help us understand the patterns and trends in the data.

# Next, 
we'll use machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to build a predictive model that can identify which customers are most likely to churn. We'll train the model using historical data and then test it on a holdout set of data to evaluate its accuracy and performance.

# Finally, 
we'll use the insights from the predictive model to take proactive steps to retain customers who are at risk of churning. For example, we might send targeted emails or offer special promotions to incentivize them to stay with the service.

By combining spreadsheet analysis and machine learning algorithms, we can develop a powerful predictive model that helps us retain customers and improve the overall health of the business.
