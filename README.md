# Churn-Machine-Learning

In this project, we want to develop a predictive model to identify customers who are at risk of churning (i.e., cancelling their subscription or leaving the service) so that we can take proactive steps to retain them. To do this, we plan to use a combination of spreadsheet analysis and machine learning algorithms.

*First*, we'll start by analyzing historical data on customer behavior, such as the frequency of usage, the types of features used, and the length of time since they last used the service. We'll use spreadsheet tools like Excel or Google Sheets to create pivot tables and charts that help us understand the patterns and trends in the data.

*Next*, we'll use machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to build a predictive model that can identify which customers are most likely to churn. We'll train the model using historical data and then test it on a holdout set of data to evaluate its accuracy and performance.

*Finally*, we'll use the insights from the predictive model to take proactive steps to retain customers who are at risk of churning. For example, we might send targeted emails or offer special promotions to incentivize them to stay with the service.

By combining spreadsheet analysis and machine learning algorithms, we can develop a powerful predictive model that helps us retain customers and improve the overall health of the business.

# Logistic Regression

In this code, we first import the necessary libraries (pandas, scikit-learn's logistic regression model, and the train_test_split function for splitting the data into training and testing sets).

We then load the data from a CSV file and select the relevant features and target variable. We split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function.

We then create an instance of the logistic regression model and fit it to the training data using the fit method. We then use the predict method to make predictions on the test set.

Finally, we evaluate the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

Note that this is just an example and the actual code for implementing a machine learning algorithm will depend on the specific problem and dataset.

# Decision Tree

In this code, we first import the necessary libraries (pandas, scikit-learn's decision tree model, and the train_test_split function for splitting the data into training and testing sets).

We then load the data from a CSV file and select the relevant features and target variable. We split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function.

We then create an instance of the decision tree classifier and fit it to the training data using the fit method. We then use the predict method to make predictions on the test set.

Finally, we evaluate the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

# Random Forest

In this code, we first import the necessary libraries (pandas, scikit-learn's random forest model, and the train_test_split function for splitting the data into training and testing sets).

We then load the data from a CSV file and select the relevant features and target variable. We split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function.

We then create an instance of the random forest classifier and fit it to the training data using the fit method. In this case, we specify that we want to use 100 decision trees and limit their maximum depth to 5. We then use the predict method to make predictions on the test set.

Finally, we evaluate the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

# Gradient Boosting
This builds a predictive model using a Gradient Boosting Classifier from the scikit-learn library. The code loads the customer data from a CSV file, selects the relevant features and target variable, splits the data into training and testing sets, fits the gradient boosting model to the training data, makes predictions on the test set, and evaluates the model's performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. The model is trained to identify which customers are most likely to churn based on their usage frequency, account status, and other behavioral data.

# Neutrel Network

This code builds a predictive model using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network from the scikit-learn library. The code loads the customer data from a CSV file, selects the relevant features and target variable, splits the data into training and testing sets, defines the neural network architecture, fits the model to the training data, makes predictions on the test set, and evaluates the model's performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
