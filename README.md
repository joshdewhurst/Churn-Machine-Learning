# Churn-Machine-Learning

In this project, I will be developing a predictive model to identify customers who are at risk of churning, using machine learning algorithms.

To begin, I will utilize demo data on customer behavior, such as the frequency of usage, the types of features used, and the length of time since they last used the service, which was previously analyzed using spreadsheet tools like Excel or Google Sheets.

I will then implement machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to create a predictive model that can identify which customers are most likely to churn. I will train the model using historical data and evaluate its accuracy and performance on a holdout set of data.

Finally, I will use the insights from the predictive model to take proactive steps to retain customers who are at risk of churning. These actions could include targeted emails or special promotions to incentivize them to continue using the service.

By using machine learning algorithms, I will develop a powerful predictive model that helps to retain customers and improve the overall health of the business. While I will not be creating pivot tables in this project, I will still utilize previously conducted spreadsheet analysis to inform my approach.


# Code and Approach
I will be using Python for this project and will be creating separate folders for each of the following machine learning algorithms:

1. Decision Trees
2. Neural Networks
3. Gradient Boosting
4. Random Forests
5. Logistic Regression

## Decision Trees
Decision trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression. In this approach, a tree-like model is built where each internal node represents a test on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable based on several input variables.

In the Decision Trees folder, I will be implementing the decision tree algorithm using the scikit-learn library. I will explain the code and how the algorithm works in detail in the README file in the folder.

## Neutral Networks
Neural networks are a set of algorithms that are modeled after the human brain. They are used to recognize patterns and to cluster and classify data. Neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes that process information, with each layer processing information in a hierarchical way.

In the Neural Networks folder, I will be implementing a simple neural network using the TensorFlow library. I will explain the code and how the algorithm works in detail in the README file in the folder.

## Gradient Boosting
Gradient Boosting is a machine learning technique used for regression and classification problems. It builds an ensemble of weak learners (usually decision trees) and combines them to produce a strong learner. The model is built in a stage-wise manner, with each subsequent model trying to correct the errors of the previous model.

In the Gradient Boosting folder, I will be implementing the gradient boosting algorithm using the XGBoost library. I will explain the code and how the algorithm works in detail in the README file in the folder.

## Random Forests
Random Forests are a type of ensemble learning method that combine multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy of the model. In a random forest, each tree is built on a random sample of the data and a random subset of the features. The final prediction is then made by aggregating the predictions of all the trees.

In the Random Forests folder, I will be implementing the random forest algorithm using the scikit-learn library. I will explain the code and how the algorithm works in detail in the README file in the folder.

## Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a type of regression analysis used to predict the outcome of a categorical dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. It is a simple and widely used algorithm for binary classification problems.

In the Logistic Regression folder, I will be implementing the logistic regression algorithm using the scikit-learn library. I will explain the code and how the algorithm works in detail in the README file in the folder.

# Further Applications
The techniques used in this project can be applied to many other domains such as finance, healthcare, and marketing. By predicting customer churn, businesses can take proactive steps to retain their customers and improve their overall profitability.
